"""Destructive maintenance operations: wipe a project, a molecule, or everything.

Separate from ``routes.py`` so the deletion logic can be read and tested on
its own -- these functions delete data that cannot be recovered.

Every operation comes in two halves: a ``preview_*`` that only counts, and a
``wipe_*`` that acts. The API layer always shows the preview first and
requires the caller to echo back an exact confirmation string.

Deletion order matters. The foreign keys form a cycle:

    computation_jobs      -> computation_tasks
    computation_tasks     -> molecule_states, molecule_geometries, itself
    molecule_geometries   -> molecule_states, computation_tasks
    molecule_states       -> molecules

so the task/geometry references are nulled out before either table is
deleted. SQLite runs with ``PRAGMA foreign_keys=ON`` (see ``db.py``), which
would otherwise reject the delete.

``computation_headers`` are never touched: they are shared across projects
and referenced by rows that may survive.

Deleting the files is the slow half -- ~65 ms per file on this deployment's
network mount, so minutes for a real project. A project wipe and a database
reset therefore *stage* the directories (one rename each) and answer the
request immediately, leaving a background thread to do the unlinking. See
:class:`_BackgroundRemoval`.
